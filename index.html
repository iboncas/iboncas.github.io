      <h2>Technical Architecture and Functionality</h2>
      <p>IoT devices equipped with Sigfox connectivity integrate a small and energy-efficient module that includes a radio transceiver. This module is responsible for transmitting and receiving data using the Sigfox communication protocol. It also uses a proprietary ultra-narrowband radio protocol for communication between devices and base stations. The ultra-narrowband approach involves using very narrow frequency channels, which enables better propagation and penetration through obstacles.</p>
      <p>Sigfox's network infrastructure includes a series of base stations strategically deployed to cover specific geographic areas. These base stations receive messages from IoT devices and forward them to the Sigfox Cloud, which serves as a central hub for processing and managing the information. The cloud infrastructure is responsible for tasks such as decoding messages, security checks, and routing data to the appropriate destination. Sigfox's backend systems include servers and databases responsible for handling device registrations, managing network sessions, and ensuring the integrity and security of the data.</p>
      <p>Sigfox provides APIs that enable seamless integration with third-party applications and services. This allows developers and businesses to build applications, dashboards, and analytics tools that leverage the data transmitted by Sigfox-enabled devices. Security is a critical aspect of the Sigfox architecture. The protocol incorporates encryption mechanisms to secure the communication between devices and the Sigfox Cloud. Sigfox operates on a subscription-based model, where users subscribe to the service to connect their devices to the Sigfox network. Subscription management is handled through the backend systems.</p>
      <h4>Communication for IoT Devices</h3>
      <p>Sigfox is designed for IoT devices that typically transmit small amounts of data infrequently. Low data rate reduces the time each device spends communicating, leading to lower power consumption.</p>
      <p>Sigfox operates in the sub-GHz frequency bands (868 MHz in Europe, 902 MHz in the United States), which are lower frequencies than those used by traditional cellular networks.</p>
      <p>Sigfox employs synchronized communication between devices and base stations. This synchronization helps optimize network resources, reduce collisions, and enhance overall efficiency. Devices can transmit data at specific time slots, minimizing the time they spend actively communicating and conserving energy.</p>
      <h4>Modulation Techniques</h3>
      <p>Sigfox uses a proprietary modulation scheme known as Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) for its communication. BPSK is a digital modulation technique that encodes data by varying the phase of the transmitted signal. In the case of Sigfox, the modulation is binary, meaning it has two possible phases. The BPSK modulation in Sigfox is designed to be robust, allowing for reliable communication over long distances and in challenging radio environments.</p>
